.. note::
   This documentation page is for your own use as you best see fit for your project.

   In some cases it might be enough with the README.md in the project root, however
   you might use this if you want to publish API documentation, or have a website
   where you want to make detailed project information available (you can e.g.
   publish direct from blob storage).

   To generate documentation install make and from the docs folder run:

      .. code-block::

         make html

   On Windows you can use the .bat file so from the docs folder just run:

      .. code-block::

         make html
